			  <h3 class="">Prototype of Zelda-like PC game</h3>
			  <p class="">This was the first group project I took part in. It's a prototype of and top down action-adventure game, where the player takes control of a character and navigates him through the are while fighting monsters. Player can walk, slash the character's sword to hurt the hostile creatures and drink potions to recover lost health. My task was mainly to design and program gameplay mechanics, however I also took part in character, enemy and level design. The game's engine was written from ground up using Monogame framework. This prototype's development stopped at tutorial level.<br></p>

			  <h3 class="">Prototype of endless driving mobile game</h3>
			  <p class="">Another group project I took part in. The game is an endless driver where the player's goal is to manouver around incoming cars while collecting gasoline tanks along the way. Hitting another car takes away one life and triggers an explosion. The player also has an option to activate a panic button, which clears the board of incoming cars. Once it’s activated, the screen-wide explosion occurs and it becomes unavailable for several seconds. My job in this project was to design and program gameplay mechanics.  The game was developer in Unity with mobile devices and microtransactions in mind.<br></p>

			  <h3 class="">Prototype of a 2D fighting game with platformer elements</h3>
			  <p class="">This solo project was a basis of my thesis, “Arcade action game with platforming elements and advanced combat system”. It is a 2D fighting game with platforming elements developed in Unity. The game enriches fundamental fighting game mechanics with movement options that allow players to smoothly navigate the environment by clinging to and launching of the walls, as well as performing air dashes. Players have a wide array of attacks to perform, their animations and properties depending on the current state of their character.  Players can perform combos by linking appropriate moves together as well as defend and punish their opponents for committing to risky moves. The fighting system and gameplay mechanics were designed and coded by me based on universal fighting game concepts. I also created the character model and 60+ animations tied to it using Blender. This project granted me a title of Bachelor (inżynier) of Software Engineering.<br></p>
